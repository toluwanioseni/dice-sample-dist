    "This outputs a 5 by 10 numpy array, which represent of five the result of five iterations of drawing a die from the bag, rolling it 10 times, and returning it to the bag. Each row gives the results of one draw. The first argument to `generate_sample` indicates that the bag contains 4 type 0 dice and 6 type 1 dice. The second argument provides the probability of rolling each of four faces on each die type. The last two arguments are the number of draws and the number of rolls per draw, respectively. The output contains many 3s because die type 1 favors 3's and there are more type 1 dice in the bag than type 0 dice. Remember that python is zero-indexed so the first die type is denoted by a 0 and the first face on each die is also referred to as face 0."
