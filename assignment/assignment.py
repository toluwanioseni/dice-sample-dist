# In function definitions for this class you will see types after each argument
# and the return type after the list of arguments with the syntax shown below. We
# expect all functions you write to also have types specified. The mypy extension
# to vscode will check that types are correct and report inconsistencies in the
# "problems" tab below the editor. If you are interested to learn more, go here:
